    fullDescription: `
  Every year, households around the world waste over 630 million tonnes of food, costing approximately $1 trillion and contributing 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This isn't just an environmental crisis, it's hitting families financially as well. A typical American family could save around $1,600 annually by eliminating food waste. The problem exists across cultures and continents, with per capita food waste ranging from 100kg/year in North America to 5kg/year in Sub-Saharan Africa.
  
  Freshify is a mobile app that uses push notifications to remind you when your groceries are about to expire.
  
  Every time you come back from the grocery store, simply snap a photo of your receipt and take a photo of the items, and Freshify will (using GPT-4o's image recognition) automatically detect the items' expiration date and notify you when they're about to expire.
  
  Freshify also comes with a recipe generator, prioritizing ingredients that are about to expire.
  
  Here's a demo video!

  I implemented the AI backend, the scanning functionalities, including the recipe scanning and image recognition. It was my first time using the OpenAI API, and I was amazed at how well it was able to recognize the items in the image.

(picture unrelated, I just love Shanghai)

For Stem Fellowship's Big Data Challenge, my team and I analyzed proximity to ammenities and demographic data for a given address in the US. We won 1st place out of 160 teamsand $1000!

I led the data sampling part, where I used [OpenAddresses](https://openaddresses.io/) to simple random sampling 163 counties from 1,936 available and stratified random sampling 1,630 unique addresses. This enabled the analysis of housing proximity to amenities with educational attainment and demographic relationships.

We then used the Geoapify API to get the distance to the nearest amenity, and used ArcGIS to get education and demographic data for analysis for each address sampled.

Here's my teammate Adam explaining our project in detail:

    description: "from PHY180, PHY293, PHY294",

    fullDescription: `
As part of the Engineering Science curriculum, I took 3 physics courses: [PHY180](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/undergraduate/current-and-prospective-students/undergraduate-courses/elements-of-physics-i/) (Classical Mechanics), [PHY293](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/undergraduate/current-and-prospective-students/undergraduate-courses/waves-and-modern-physics/) (Waves & Modern Physics), and [PHY294](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/undergraduate/current-and-prospective-students/undergraduate-courses/quantum-and-thermal-physics/) (Quantum & Thermal Physics). Here are various physics experiments I did in each course and my reports on them.

## PHY180
### Pendulum - [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jGUGThsQglmvLwHygEQlEFU2Qb0ysxXC/view?usp=sharing)

For PHY180, I wrote a paper on the physics of a simple pendulum. I investigated the roughly parabolic correlation between a pendulum's drop angle and its period. I then analyzed how the pendulum's amplitude decays over time, which closely followed an exponential function when dropped from low enough angles. From this, I calculated the Quality Factor to quantify damping. Finally, I explored how changing the pendulum's length affects its motion, finding that while length doesn't significantly affect the Q factor, the period increases approximately with a power-law relationship.

## PHY293

### Charge-to-Mass Ratio for the Electron - [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17liCblhUc09byRuuL5MX6z-OtZGn4kN3/view?usp=sharing)

The charge-to-mass ratio (e/m) of the electron is a fundamental property first measured by J. J. Thomson in 1895, highlighting the behavior of charged particles under electromagnetic forces. In this experiment, the motion of an electron in a uniform magnetic field is studied to determine its e/m ratio.

### Interferometry - [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HbUa9vICd9rei3bwiFIP9Lo9wAgOK1gZ/view?usp=sharing)

For the second experiment in PHY293, I measured the wavelength of green and red light using interferometry with a Michelson interferometer. This is a precise technique for measuring small distances, wavelengths, and material properties through light interference patterns. In a Michelson interferometer, light is split into two paths. One directed toward a fixed mirror and the other toward a movable mirror. When these beams recombine, they create an interference pattern with many fringes, sensitive to path length changes. Counting the number of fringes that pass by as the mirror moves allows us to calculate the wavelength of the light.

## PHY294

### Rydberg Constant - [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RhK4qMIhfDLvb-j2wXmzULt6HVNJySo9/view?usp=sharing)

In this experiment, we measured the spectral lines of hydrogen using a spectrometer to experimentally determine the Rydberg constant. By observing the Balmer series and plotting the inverse of the squared wavelengths, we obtained a linear relationship that allowed us to extract an experimental Rydberg constant within acceptable uncertainty of the theoretical value. This experiment reinforced the quantized nature of atomic energy levels and the predictive power of the Bohr model.

### Photoelectric Effect - [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wO5Ck5qN00lGmOndGUuJVcVDK3CxFI9R/view?usp=sharing)

We investigated the photoelectric effect to determine Planck's constant and verify Einstein's equation. By measuring the stopping voltage for various light frequencies, we found a linear relationship consistent with the photon theory of light. The slope and intercept of the fitted data yielded values for Planck's constant and the work function of the photocathode material. We also confirmed that stopping potential is independent of light intensity, while photocurrent scales with it, further supporting the quantum description of light.

### Polarization of Light - [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/147zGH0Sdm0RRHyTmhxyfgO3Ip9BgjcpZ/view?usp=sharing)

This lab explored three core concepts in light polarization: Malus' Law, the effect of inserting a third polarizer, and Brewster's angle. Using a diode laser, polarizers, and a photodetector, we experimentally verified the cosÂ²Î¸ relationship predicted by Malus' Law and observed sinusoidal transmission through three polarizers. We also estimated the Brewster angle for acrylic using reflected light intensity data and bootstrapping to quantify uncertainty, enabling the calculation of its refractive index.

For the [CIV102](https://orientation.engsci.utoronto.ca/civ102-structures-and-materials/) course project, my team and I designed and constructed a 1200mm long bridge using only a single piece of matboard and contact cement. Here it is in action:

Our bridge:
- Supported a peak moving load of **840 N** (over 180 lbs!!)
- Tied for **first place** in our section based on peak load capacity
- Achieved **third place** overall in the cohort for power-to-weight ratio efficiency

I led the cross-sectional design process, which involved:
- Performing extensive structural calculations
- Iterating through multiple design variations
- Optimizing performance through analytical modeling

Initially attempting to use MATLAB and Python for calculations, I pivoted to Google Sheets for efficiency, which proved effective for our analytical needs. The project showcased practical applications of structural engineering principles and the importance of iterative design optimization.

Below are the detailed structural calculations used to optimize our bridge design, including parameters for each section, stress analysis, and safety factors:

I personally can never focus while listening to music, let alone rap music with lots of lyrics. However, many of my friends claim they study better with music, so I decided to put it to the test.

For my Probability & Statistics (ECE286) course project, my team and I decided to investigate the effect of lyrical rap on speed and accuracy of solving integrals. 24 second-year Engineering Science students were assigned to complete a set oftwo Calculus II level integrals with or without the influence of rap music. 

I conducted the data collection and analysis in R Studio. It was my first time using R, so I had to learn as I went along.

Their solution times and accuracy were measured and results showed that the music group had a slightly lower mean score (6.8 vs 7.6 out of 10) and an equal mean time (about 8.5 minutes).

For JAMHacks 6, my team and I built **Telenotes**, which is a mobile app that transforms spoken thoughts into organized notes using natural language processing. The idea stemmed from a simple question: _why do we forget most of our thoughts?_ We wanted to eliminate the friction between thinking and recording ideas, so we built something we'd genuinely use.

**Telenote:**
- Converts speech to structured notes using IBM Watson NLP
- Supports command-based classification for rapid thought sorting
- Built with React Native (frontend) and Express.js (backend)

I mainly focused on the frontend, which was my first time coding with JavaScript. This was before any LLMs were released, so learning and coding on the fly was a real challenge.

Despite initial roadblocks with Google's API, switching to IBM Watson led to quick and accurate results. This project deepened my understanding of NLP pipelines, mobile-backend communication, and the importance of designing around user accessibility.

Look at that satisfying vortex!

The inspiration for this project is a [magnetic stirrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stirrer) used in chemistry labs. A small magnetic stir bar in liquid is rotated by an motor, controlled by a button, creating a vortex that is so mesmerizing to watch.

To build this toy, I tore apart a cheap magnetic stirrer and used the motor and stir bar. The liquid I used is tonic water, which illuminates under UV light. I then CADed a water tight enclosure using rubber gaskets, added a button, and a flexible UV lamp. I then machined the parts on a lathe and drill press (and also manually threaded the support shafts... not fun), and delivered the final product to the school.
