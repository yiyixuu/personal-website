This isn't just an environmental crisis, it's hitting families financially as well. A typical American family could save around $1,600 annually by eliminating food waste. The problem exists across cultures and continents, with per capita food waste ranging from 100kg/year in North America to 5kg/year in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n  \n  Freshify is a mobile app that uses push notifications to remind you when your groceries are about to expire.\n  \n  Every time you come back from the grocery store, simply snap a photo of your receipt and take a photo of the items, and Freshify will (using GPT-4o's image recognition) automatically detect the items' expiration date and notify you when they're about to expire.\n  \n  Freshify also comes with a recipe generator, prioritizing ingredients that are about to expire.\n  \n  Here's a demo video!\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MwFF6PgIQ4w?si=0Bs66-xstlYVwl4t\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  \n  I implemented the AI backend, the scanning functionalities, including the recipe scanning and image recognition.

Here are various physics experiments I did in each course and my reports on them.\n\n## PHY180\n### Pendulum - [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jGUGThsQglmvLwHygEQlEFU2Qb0ysxXC/view?usp=sharing)\n\nFor PHY180, I wrote a paper on the physics of a simple pendulum. I investigated the roughly parabolic correlation between a pendulum's drop angle and its period. I then analyzed how the pendulum's amplitude decays over time, which closely followed an exponential function when dropped from low enough angles. From this, I calculated the Quality Factor to quantify damping. Finally, I explored how changing the pendulum's length affects its motion, finding that while length doesn't significantly affect the Q factor, the period increases approximately with a power-law relationship.\n\n<img src=\"/images/pendulum.png\" alt=\"Pendulum\" className=\"rounded-lg border border-zinc-800\" />\n\n## PHY293\n\n### Charge-to-Mass Ratio for the Electron - [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17liCblhUc09byRuuL5MX6z-OtZGn4kN3/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe charge-to-mass ratio (e/m) of the electron is a fundamental property first measured by J. J. Thomson in 1895, highlighting the behavior of charged particles under electromagnetic forces. In this experiment, the motion of an electron in a uniform magnetic field is studied to determine its e/m ratio.\n\n<img src=\"/images/chargetomass1.png\" alt=\"Charge-to-Mass Ratio for the Electron\" className=\"rounded-lg border border-zinc-800\" />\n<img src=\"/images/chargetomass2.png\" alt=\"Charge-to-Mass Ratio for the Electron\" className=\"rounded-lg border border-zinc-800\" />\n\n### Interferometry - [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HbUa9vICd9rei3bwiFIP9Lo9wAgOK1gZ/view?usp=sharing)\n\nFor the second experiment in PHY293, I measured the wavelength of green and red light using interferometry with a Michelson interferometer. This is a precise technique for measuring small distances, wavelengths, and material properties through light interference patterns. In a Michelson interferometer, light is split into two paths. One directed toward a fixed mirror and the other toward a movable mirror. When these beams recombine, they create an interference pattern with many fringes, sensitive to path length changes. Counting the number of fringes that pass by as the mirror moves allows us to calculate the wavelength of the light.\n\n<img src=\"/images/interferometer.png\" alt=\"Interferometry\" className=\"rounded-lg border border-zinc-800\" />\n\n## PHY294\n\n### Rydberg Constant - [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RhK4qMIhfDLvb-j2wXmzULt6HVNJySo9/view?usp=sharing)\n\nIn this experiment, we measured the spectral lines of hydrogen using a spectrometer to experimentally determine the Rydberg constant. By observing the Balmer series and plotting the inverse of the squared wavelengths, we obtained a linear relationship that allowed us to extract an experimental Rydberg constant within acceptable uncertainty of the theoretical value. This experiment reinforced the quantized nature of atomic energy levels and the predictive power of the Bohr model.\n\n<img src=\"/images/rydberg.png\" alt=\"Rydberg Constant\" className=\"rounded-lg border border-zinc-800\" />\n\n### Photoelectric Effect - [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wO5Ck5qN00lGmOndGUuJVcVDK3CxFI9R/view?usp=sharing)\n\nWe investigated the photoelectric effect to determine Planck's constant and verify Einstein's equation. By measuring the stopping voltage for various light frequencies, we found a linear relationship consistent with the photon theory of light. The slope and intercept of the fitted data yielded values for Planck's constant and the work function of the photocathode material. We also confirmed that stopping potential is independent of light intensity, while photocurrent scales with it, further supporting the quantum description of light.\n\n<img src=\"/images/photoelectric.png\" alt=\"Photoelectric Effect\" className=\"rounded-lg border border-zinc-800\" />\n\n### Polarization of Light - [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/147zGH0Sdm0RRHyTmhxyfgO3Ip9BgjcpZ/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThis lab explored three core concepts in light polarization: Malus' Law, the effect of inserting a third polarizer, and Brewster's angle. Using a diode laser, polarizers, and a photodetector, we experimentally verified the cos²θ relationship predicted by Malus' Law and observed sinusoidal transmission through three polarizers. We also estimated the Brewster angle for acrylic using reflected light intensity data and bootstrapping to quantify uncertainty, enabling the calculation of its refractive index.\n\n<img src=\"/images/polarization.png\" alt=\"Polarization of Light\" className=\"rounded-lg border border-zinc-800\" />\n`,\n    technologies: [\"Python\", \"LabView\", \"LaTeX\"],\n    role: \"Physicist\",\n    collaborators: [\n      {\n        name: \"Aryan Nehete\",\n        link: \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryan-nehete/?originalSubdomain=ca\",\n      },\n      {\n        name: \"Chase Graci\",\n        link: \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chase-graci-5a7099232/\",\n      },\n    ],\n    link: \"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12BJBw85iZWYwT6ixSqrp3DInpyKq-hcu?usp=sharing\",\n    linkText: \"View All Reports\",\n    color: \"bg-gray-900\",\n    featured: true,\n  },\n  \"matboard-beam-bridge\": {\n    title: \"Matboard Beam Bridge\",\n    description: \"1200mm long bridge made from 1 piece of matboard\",\n    fullDescription: `\nFor the [CIV102](https://orientation.engsci.utoronto.ca/civ102-structures-and-materials/) course project, my team and I designed and constructed a 1200mm long bridge using only a single piece of matboard and contact cement.
